# Augmented Adversarial Dataset

This repository contains **a few representative samples** of the augmented adversarial malware data used in the research paper:

**"An integration approach of fine-tuned language model and heterogeneous graph learning with adversarial data augmentation for Windows malware detection"**

## 📂 Repository Contents

This dataset includes a small selection of synthetic malware samples generated using the adversarial augmentation framework proposed in our study. These samples are provided as examples to demonstrate the data structure and support reproducibility.
